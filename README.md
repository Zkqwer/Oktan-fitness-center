# Oktan-fitness-center

I suggested my friend to make a new website for one fitness company in our city, I did the main idea of the page appearance, etc., then my friend made the functionality through flask and psycopg2 with a PostgreSQL database.
In short, my friend did the whole backend: https://github.com/middelmatigheid/flask-oktan
